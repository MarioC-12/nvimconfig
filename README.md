# NVIM DOTFILE
This repository contains my nvim dotfile. 

It includes LSP support, multiple LuaSnip snippets and more plugins.

# Installation
To directly install the plugin, you can execute the install script:
This script will simply make a backup of your previous configuration (if it 
exists) and then a symbolic link from this folder to the neovim configuration
folder. 

To execute it, you will probably first need to give it the necessary permissions. 
For that, simply execute `chmod +x install.sh`.
